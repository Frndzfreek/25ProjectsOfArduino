Basic BLINK TEST to check whether the arduino is in working condition
CODE:
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initializing digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);  // turns the builtin led on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                      // wait for ONE second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);   // turns the builtin led off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                      // wait for ONE second
}
